<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spine Surgery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Spine Surgery</li><li>Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spine surgery market is primarily divided into two types: open spine surgery and minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS). Open spine surgery involves larger incisions to access the spinal structures, allowing for extensive procedures but often leading to longer recovery times and increased postoperative discomfort. In contrast, minimally invasive spine surgery utilizes smaller incisions and specialized techniques, resulting in reduced tissue damage, shorter hospital stays, and quicker recovery periods. The choice between the two depends on the patient's condition and specific surgical needs.</p></p>
